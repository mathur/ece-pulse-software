In this challenge, we exploited a heartbleed-like bug in a server given to us in order to get the private key.

The private key we found is located in `key.txt`

The importance of a private key is that it is the "key" or cipher term that will encrypt a message. In the same way, this same private key is the cipher term that will be used to decrypt a message. If a 3rd party can access this key, they can read all communications between two secret parties.
